Perfect! Let’s create a **starter GitHub Template repo** for Flutter with:

* **Full folder structure**
* **README.md with guidance**
* **CI/CD workflow**
* **Linting / formatting setup**

Here’s a complete setup you can copy directly into a repository:

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
flutter-app-template/

```

# 🚀 Flutter App Template

A **production-ready Flutter app starter template** with CI/CD, linting, and best practices.  
Use this template to quickly bootstrap Flutter apps with consistent structure.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `lib/` → App source code  
- `test/` → Unit & widget tests  
- `docs/` → Project documentation  
- `.github/workflows/` → CI/CD pipelines  
- `analysis_options.yaml` → Linting rules  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/flutter-app-template
cd flutter-app-template
flutter pub get
flutter run
````

---

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

* Branching: `feature/`, `fix/`, `release/`
* Commits: follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
* Linting: `flutter analyze`
* Format: `dart format .`
* Test: `flutter test`

---

## 🤖 CI/CD Pipeline

Workflow: `.github/workflows/flutter_ci.yml`

* Run `flutter analyze`
* Run tests
* Optional: Build validation

---

## 📦 Deployment (Optional)

* Firebase App Distribution
* Fastlane for iOS/Android releases

## ⚙️ `analysis_options.yaml` (Linting)

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    prefer_const_constructors: true
    avoid_print: true
    always_use_package_imports: true
````

---

## 🤖 GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/flutter_ci.yml`)

```yaml
name: Flutter CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.22.0'
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter analyze
      - run: flutter test
```

If you want, I can **also generate all the supporting Markdown files** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`, `bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`) so your template repo is **ready-to-use immediately**.

Do you want me to do that next?
